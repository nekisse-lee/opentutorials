<p>
    <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a
    high-level, interpreted programming language. It is
    a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside
    <span>HTML</span>
    and <span>CSS</span>, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web
    content engineering. It is used to make
    webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all
    modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in <span
        class="js">JavaScript</span>
    engine. Each of the
    many <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engines represent a different implementation of <span
        class="js">JavaScript</span>, all based on the ECMAScript
    specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features
    beyond ECMA.
